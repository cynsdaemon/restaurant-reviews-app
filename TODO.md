# TODO

- [ X ]  Convert the provided site to use a responsive design.
- [ X ]  Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS.
- [ X ]  Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
- [ X ]  Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
- [ X ]  Use media queries that provide id breakpoints across different screen sizes
- [ X ]  Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
- [ X ]  Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).
- [ X ]  Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.
